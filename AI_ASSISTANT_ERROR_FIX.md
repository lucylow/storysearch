# AI Assistant Error Fix

## Problem Identified

The AI assistant was showing the error: **"Sorry, I encountered an error processing your request. Please try again."**

**Root Cause**: OpenAI API error 429 - "Too Many Requests" / Rate limit exceeded

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in Supabase Function
- **File**: `supabase/functions/ai-chat/index.ts`
- **Changes**: Added specific error messages for different HTTP status codes:
  - 429: Rate limit exceeded → "AI service is currently busy. Please try again in a few moments."
  - 401: Authentication failed → "AI service authentication failed. Please contact support."
  - 402: Quota exceeded → "AI service quota exceeded. Please contact support."
  - 500+: Server errors → "AI service is experiencing technical difficulties. Please try again later."

### 2. Improved Frontend Error Handling
- **File**: `src/hooks/useAIChat.ts`
- **Changes**: Added user-friendly error messages based on error type:
  - Rate limit errors → "I'm currently processing many requests. Please wait a moment and try again."
  - Quota errors → "I've reached my usage limit for today. Please try again tomorrow or contact support."
  - Authentication errors → "There's a configuration issue with my AI service. Please contact support."
  - Technical errors → "I'm experiencing technical difficulties. Please try again in a few minutes."

### 3. Added Retry Functionality
- **File**: `src/components/Search/AIChatInterface.tsx`
- **Changes**: Added "Try Again" button for error messages to allow users to retry failed requests.

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Deploy via Supabase CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Login to Supabase
npx supabase login

# Deploy the updated function
npx supabase functions deploy ai-chat --project-ref pmffcmztmijonvnbzctu
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment via Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/pmffcmztmijonvnbzctu/functions)
2. Navigate to Functions → ai-chat
3. Replace the function code with the updated version from `supabase/functions/ai-chat/index.ts`
4. Deploy the function

## OpenAI API Configuration

The error suggests the OpenAI API key may have:
1. **Exceeded rate limits** - Too many requests per minute
2. **Exceeded quota** - Monthly usage limit reached
3. **Invalid/expired key** - API key needs to be updated

### To Fix OpenAI API Issues:

1. **Check API Usage**: Go to [OpenAI Usage Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/usage)
2. **Update API Key**: If needed, generate a new API key at [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
3. **Set Environment Variable**: Update the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your Supabase project:
   ```bash
   # Via Supabase CLI
   npx supabase secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_new_api_key --project-ref pmffcmztmijonvnbzctu
   
   # Or via Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
   ```

## Testing the Fix

After deployment, test the AI chat functionality:

1. **Normal Operation**: Send a simple message like "Hello"
2. **Error Handling**: The improved error messages should now be more specific
3. **Retry Functionality**: If an error occurs, users can click "Try Again"

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- **Rate Limit Errors**: Users see "I'm currently processing many requests. Please wait a moment and try again."
- **Quota Errors**: Users see "I've reached my usage limit for today. Please try again tomorrow or contact support."
- **Retry Button**: Users can retry failed requests without re-typing their message
- **Better UX**: More informative error messages instead of generic "error processing request"

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Monitor API Usage**: Set up alerts for OpenAI API usage approaching limits
2. **Implement Caching**: Consider caching common responses to reduce API calls
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement client-side rate limiting to prevent excessive requests
4. **Fallback Responses**: Consider implementing fallback responses for common queries when API is unavailable

## Files Modified

- `supabase/functions/ai-chat/index.ts` - Enhanced error handling
- `src/hooks/useAIChat.ts` - Improved error messages
- `src/components/Search/AIChatInterface.tsx` - Added retry functionality
